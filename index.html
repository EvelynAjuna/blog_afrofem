            in software than hardware and Iam specializing more in software skills. Until now the skills
            that i have are python programming, arduino programming and embeded systems and Iam
            currently learning about web development. I expect to complete my university studies in 2023 </p>

            <p style = "font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">Baking cakes has been my hobie since 
            when i was young because my mom is also a baker therefore i learnt the skills from her.
            I started learning on how to bake and decorate cakes when i was four years so its
            something that i have grown doing. Apart from that i bake breads at home</p>

            <p style = "font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">In terms of entertainment i enjoy
            watching cartoons and other types of animations. Some of my favourites are Ice age, Raph
            breaks the internet, Moana, The boss baby and many others. Apart from cartoons i enjoy music
            ,Indian love stories and Got talent shows most especially American Got Talent. I love 
            princesses such as princess Sofia, Cinderella and Rapunzel, i really wish that i once dress
            like them</p>
